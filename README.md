# Ola-_Dashboard
I have created this Ola dashboard by combining SQL and Power BI. 

I applied complex queries to extract relevant data and derive insights and I used Power BI for data cleaning, DAX formulas, visualization and created an interactive dashboard.

The project analyze various insights such as:

Ride Volume Over Time, Booking Status Breakdown, Vehicle Types by Ride Distance, Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type by Driver and Customer, Cancelled Rides Reasons by Drivers and Customers, Revenue by Payment Method, Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value, Ride Distance Distribution Per Day, Revenue by Payment method and Ride Distance Distribution per day.
